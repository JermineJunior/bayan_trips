    | Single source of truth for every permission in the application, grouped
    | by feature area for readability. Each key follows the
    | `<feature>.<action>` convention and is stored verbatim in the
    | `permissions` table (guard: web).
    |
    | The PermissionSeeder reads this file and syncs it into the database:
    | permissions listed here are created if missing, and any permission that
    | exists in the DB but no longer appears here is reported.
    |
    | To add a permission: add its key to the relevant group, then re-run
    |
    |   php artisan db:seed --class=PermissionSeeder
    |   php artisan db:seed --class=RoleSeeder        # re-syncs seeded roles
